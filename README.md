# Java Small Inventory System
 
I did a project for my Java OOP module where I had to develop a program to manage an online shopping system. 

The program has a console system from  where the user can add new products with their unique IDs and details, delete the products if needed, display all the saved products, and
save them into a separate file when the program is closed, and read the file when the program runs again.

The program also has a fully implemented GUI created with the Java Swing library. From the GUI, the user can select different products from a table displaying details such as Product ID, Type, Name, Price, Quantity and more. The user can also add the selected product to a shopping cart, which can be displayed in a separate window where they
can visualise their products added to the shopping cart and the final price.

In this project, I display my knowledge in object-oriented programming on how to work, create abstract classes and interfaces, and implement them into other classes to create objects. 
Furthermore, I demonstrate my technical knowledge of how to produce GUI elements with the Java Swing library.
